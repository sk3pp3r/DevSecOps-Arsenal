## 🤔 What is DevSecOps?

**DevSecOps** ensures security is integrated at every phase of the DevOps lifecycle—planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, operating, and monitoring. It emphasizes automation, collaboration, and enforcement to bridge development, security, and operations. Learn more:

## 🔍 What is SDLC and SSDLC?

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The **SDLC** is a framework that defines the processes and phases involved in software development, including:
1. Planning 📝
2. Analysis 📊
3. Design 🎨
4. Implementation 💻
5. Testing 🧪
6. Deployment 🚀
7. Maintenance 🔄

### Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC)
**SSDLC** integrates security practices into each phase of the SDLC. It ensures vulnerabilities are addressed early, reducing risks and costs. Key practices include:
- **Threat Modeling** during planning and design.
- **Static Analysis** during development.
- **Dynamic Testing** before deployment.

### How They Work Together
The SSDLC augments the SDLC by embedding security checks at every stage. This alignment ensures that security becomes a fundamental part of the development process rather than an afterthought, fostering secure and high-quality software.
